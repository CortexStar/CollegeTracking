ey Changes and Explanations for Smoother Editing:

SemesterDropdown.tsx (Conceptual Structure):

I've created a plausible structure for SemesterDropdown.tsx based on the props it receives from GradesPage.tsx.

It includes handling for displaying semester names, course details (ID, Title, Grade, Credits), and actions like add/remove.

It uses lucide-react for icons as is common with shadcn/ui.

Styling the Input (className on <Input />):

w-full h-full: Makes the input try to take the full width and height of its parent cell.

px-1 py-0.5: These padding values are chosen to be minimal. Crucially, the <span> displaying the text when not editing should also have similar padding (or its parent div should provide consistent padding for both states).

text-sm: Matches the font size of the static text.

bg-transparent: Makes the input background transparent, so it blends with the cell's background.

border-blue-500 ring-1 ring-blue-500: When editing, we show a subtle border or ring to indicate the active input field. You can make this border-transparent or border-0 if you want absolutely no border, but a subtle indicator is usually good for UX.

focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500: Customizes the focus appearance.

rounded-sm: A slight rounding.

For credits (type="number"): [appearance:textfield] [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:appearance-none [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:appearance-none is added to hide the default number input spinners for a cleaner look.

Styling the Static Text (<span>):

block w-full h-full: Makes the span behave like a block element taking up cell space.

px-1 py-0.5: This is important. The padding here should match the input field's padding. This way, when the span is replaced by the input, the content doesn't jump due to padding changes.

cursor-text: Indicates it's clickable for editing.

hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700: Provides visual feedback on hover.

Parent Cell Styling:

The div elements that act as table cells (e.g., <div className="text-sm">) should ideally have consistent padding or their children (span and Input) should be styled to fill them without causing layout shifts. The example uses p-2 on the course row and then px-1 py-0.5 on the interactive elements.

Managing Input Value and Focus:

setEditingCourseValue: You'll need a way to update the editing.value in your GradesPage state as the user types. I've added a prop setEditingCourseValue for this. In GradesPage.tsx, you'd update the editingCourse state:

TypeScript

// In GradesPage.tsx
const setEditingCourseValue = (newValue: string) => {
  if (editingCourse) {
    setEditingCourse(prev => ({ ...prev!, value: newValue }));
  }
};
// Pass this down to SemesterDropdown
useRef and useEffect for autoFocus: The courseInputRef is used to automatically focus the input field when editing starts for a course cell. This is good UX. The same is done for semesterNameInputRef.

Saving/Cancelling Edits:

onKeyDown handlers are added to both semester name and course cell inputs to save on "Enter" and potentially revert/blur on "Escape".

onBlur={() => onSaveEditedCourse()}: Saves when the input loses focus.

To Implement in Your Project:

Adapt SemesterDropdown.tsx: Take the styling approach shown above for the Input and the corresponding span for each editable field (Course ID, Title, Grade, Credits) within your actual SemesterDropdown.tsx component.

Pass setEditingCourseValue: Make sure to implement and pass the setEditingCourseValue function from GradesPage.tsx to SemesterDropdown.tsx and connect it to the onChange of the course editing inputs.

Pass setEditedSemesterName: Similarly, for editing the semester name directly in the dropdown (if you choose to do that instead of a dialog), you'd pass setEditedSemesterName from GradesPage.tsx to update editedSemesterName state.

Test and Refine: Adjust the padding (px-, py-), font sizes, and border styles in Tailwind until the transition between static text and the input field is as smooth as possible, minimizing any perceived "expansion."
